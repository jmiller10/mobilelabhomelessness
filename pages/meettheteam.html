							<p>As a result of participating in Mobile for Humanity (M4H), an online course sponsored by Cisco through the Frugal Innovation Lab and Santa Clara's Global Social Benefit Incubator (GSBI), Solar Ear was able to identify a key need. The organization already had a great product and sustainable business model, but they lacked a way to gather test results and demographic information from customers in the field into a database.</p>
							<p>She got to work matching Solar Ear's requirements to the best available software. "One tool, Magpie, had it all. It is easily customizable so they will be able to adapt the solution to meet their needs now and in the future. We wanted to empower them to make changes so they would not have to rely on us. Another organization, World Wide Hearing, also operates in emerging markets, and they wanted an inventory management and sales consolidation tool. I tweaked Magpie to fit their needs, too. The whole point of frugal innovation is to leverage the open source tools out there to create optimum solutions," she said. </p>
