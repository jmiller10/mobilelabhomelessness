				Homelessness is a significant problem within the United States. 2.5 million youth, 
				ages 16-24 have been reported as homeless, with over 14,000 of those being in the Santa
				Clara County. The homeless' most immediate and apparent needs are the needs for proper
				housing and food, which can often prove difficult. The homeless are at a higher risk
				for sexually transmitted diseases, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and unplanned pregnancy.
				Homeless people are often in poor mental and physical health and are not able to obtain basic
				health care services. Subsequently, healthcare providers are typically not equipped to provide
				health care because the homeless lack so much information.

				<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 2em">The homeless could benefit significantly by receiving proper sexual health services and supplies. The homeless benefits from a significant amount from the Internet, which they can frequently access via libraries, Internet cafes, friends, services, or most frequently, cell phones. 62% of homeless youth currently have a cell phone. Cell phones allow the homeless to access proper housing, food, and health care much more easily. Many services are being provided to the homeless through this means of communication; we seek to explore this further with our projects.
