			<b>Youth StreetConnect II</b>
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 2em">
			An estimated 2.5 million youth, ages 16-24, experience homelessness in the US each year. These young individuals, particularly women, are considered high-risk for serious health problems, including HIV, STDs, teen pregnancy and teen dating violence. Healthcare providers can play a critical role in providing appropriate care to homeless youth and in linking them to other health services. Research suggests that linking healthcare with other services needed by homeless adolescents, such as shelter or food, may help improve their continuity of care. In this paper, we describe Youth StreetConnect, a tool formed by two mobile apps, which will connect young homeless women to local healthcare providers. Considering that cellular phones are common among homeless individuals, particularly teenagers, our tool has the potential to make an impact on these women's lives.

		<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 2em">
			Nowadays, almost everybody owns a cellular phone that can connect to the internet - including 70% of the homeless population in Santa Clara County. These phones can provide them access to resources they wouldn't have otherwise, such as information on food services, medical help, and other aid. They also serve as the sole means by which a homeless person can be contacted, as they don't have a static home address or home phone.The Community Technology Alliance is offering the unique opportunity to have standout apps come preloaded on all phones in their Mobile For All campaign. These phones will be distributed to impoverished individuals in the US who would otherwise not have access to cellular services. This is a huge initiative that aims to increase the self-sufficiency of low income and homeless individuals, and the opportunity to get your app included in their phone program will really cement your accomplishments.
